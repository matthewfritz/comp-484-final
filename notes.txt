CARD IMAGES
-----------

The card images are part of a single sprite sheet. Each card is 81px wide by 119px tall. The sprite sheet has a transparent background. There is also a height offset for each row.

- First row: 0px offset
- Second row: 2px offset
- Third row: 4px offset
- Fourth row: 5px offset
- Fifth row: 7px offset

The regular cards are in the first four rows with thirteen columns each. The rows begin with the 2 card and end with the Ace.

The columns can be represented numerically as 2 through 14.

The order of the suits per row is the following:

- First row: hearts (h)
- Second row: diamonds (d)
- Third row: clubs (c)
- Fourth row: spades (s)

The last (fifth) row has an incomplete number of columns of the following kind:

- First column: the card back
- Second column: Joker
- Third (hearts), fourth (diamonds), fifth (clubs), sixth (spades) columns: Wild 2s

From what I can tell, the images are from Deuces Wild Bonus Poker (one of my favorite games on the Game King machine in Las Vegas).

DEPENDENCIES
------------

You will need Node.js (http://nodejs.org/en) and NPM (Node Package Manager). I recommend NVM (Node Version Manager) to maintain Node versions without having to do complicated upgrades:

- OS/X and other *nix-based systems: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

- Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

Finally, you will need an installation of Composer: https://getcomposer.org/

Make sure you run "composer install" to get all of the Laravel dependencies and then "npm install" to get the Socket.io Node dependencies.

In the "socket" directory, run the following command to start the Socket.io server:
