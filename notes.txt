CARD IMAGES
-----------

The card images are part of a single sprite sheet. Each card is 50px wide by 80px tall. The sprite sheet has a transparent background.

From what I can tell, the images are possibly from Double Deuces Wild Poker (my favorite game on the Game King machine in Las Vegas).

DEPENDENCIES
------------

You will need Node.js (http://nodejs.org/en) and NPM (Node Package Manager). I recommend NVM (Node Version Manager) to maintain Node versions without having to do complicated upgrades:

- OS/X and other *nix-based systems: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

- Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

Finally, you will need an installation of Composer: https://getcomposer.org/

Make sure you run "composer install" to get all of the Laravel dependencies and then "npm install" to get the Socket.io Node dependencies.
